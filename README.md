# clean architecture
## an example in golang

This repository's main purpose is to be used as introduction to clean architecture
Originally it was created for [IEEE Aristotle University of Thessaloniki Student Branch "Clean Architecture and Event-Driven Architecture"](http://ieeesb.ee.auth.gr/2021/03/event-driven-architecture-webinar/) webinar

This project by no means can be considered production ready,
additional work is required to consider this sufficient which is outside the scope.

This project follows https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout
